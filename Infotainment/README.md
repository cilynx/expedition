# Infotainment

I was originally planning on trying to make an F150 unit work, assuming the fit might not be perfect and CAN functions might be messed up, but then I came across this KSPIV unit designed specifically for the 3rd-gen Expedition.  Overall I'm very happy with it, but it does have a few quirks I'm working through w/ KSPIV.  On that note, I have to commend KSPIV on their very personable support.  These Android units can be fairly complex and they're very responsive and open about how the unit works.

Who needs model numbers when you can have awesome SEO-driven product names like [KSPIV 4G+64G Android 9 Car Stereo 17 Inch Tesla Style Touchscreen for Ford Expedition 2007-2017 High Version Car Radio Bluetooth with Apple Carplay & Android Auto,GPS Navigation Unit,Backup Camera](https://amzn.to/3pxkje4)?

| Feature | Does it work? |
| - | - |
| Screen | Works OOTB -- vibrant and crisp |
| Split Screen | Works OOTB, but not all apps support it |
| Touch | Works OOTB including multi-touch gestures like pinch/zoom/drag, even with gloves on |
| Autodimming | Works OK OOTB, but doesn't go dim enough for night driving.  Twilight installed from the Play Store does the job better. |
| Virtual Assistant | Barely works -- you don't actually need it and I'd rather disable the overlay, but haven't figured out how to yet.  May need to follow up with KSPIV. |
| Android Auto | Works over USB and Bluetooth, but I'll never use it as native apps are nicer. |
| Cabin Mood Lighting | Has an app that matches the colors of the stock color switcher, but it doesn't seem to do anything.  I'm guessing it runs over the CAN2 connection that doesn't work.  Need to follow up with KSPIV. |
| Wireless Phone Charging | Plug [this charging mat](https://amzn.to/3ret2SZ) into one of the USB ports on the back of the head and route the cable under the unit then you can just throw your phone in the well to charge. |
| Wifi | Works OOTB.  Reception is a bit weak.  Works great with a hotspot in the truck, but can barely see my home wifi from the driveway even though my phone picks it up very well.  Antenna can be replaced, but I haven't found a good one yet. |
| Built-in 4G/5G | Non-existent -- unit does not have a SIM slot |
| Mobile connectivity | Works great OOTB with my phone's Wifi hotspot.  Works great OOTB over USB with a [Netgear M1](https://amzn.to/44uldqt).  The M1 reboots over and over if you don't have the battery in it and if you leave the battery in without driving often, the battery will die and the unit needs a few minutes of charging before it works again.  Still dialing in seamless mobile connectivity and may need to try some 4G/5G dongles, but this setup works "good enough for now". |
| Front A/C Controls | Work great OOTB |
| Rear A/C Controls | Rear Lock appears to be reversed -- rear controls work when Rear Lock is enabled on the head and the head overrides the rear controls when Rear Lock is disabled on the head. |
| Front Heated / Cooled Seats | Not currently working -- on-screen buttons don't respond to taps.  I need to follow up with KSPIV on this one. |
| Steering Wheel Controls | Volume Up/Down/Mute and Prev/Next work OOTB.  Other functions untested. |
| Door Open Display | Works OOTB so long as CAN2 is not connected |
| Speedometer / Tachometer | Don't work with or without CAN2 connected.  KSPIV recommended disconnecting CAN2 so the Door Open Display works properly and is sending me an OBDII dongle to see if we can get speedo and tach that way. |
| AM/FM Radio | Works OOTB |
| Pandora | Installs from Play Store and mostly works OOTB.  Sometimes you have to open up Radio then switch back to Pandora to get audio output. |
| Equalizer | Works OOTB, but can distort at high gain |
| Balance / Fade | L/R Balance works OOTB, but all speakers seem to be fed by the front channels.  Fading the fronts down on the head fades all speakers down and fading the rears down on the head does nothing.  Need to play around a bit with the rear controls and follow up with KSPIV.  Maybe this is similar to the Rear Lock for the A/C and I just haven't found it yet? |
| Amplifier | Works OOTB, but distorts at lower volume levels than I would expect. |
| Speakers | Plug and play with the Sony system in my truck.  My driver's door speaker is dead, but it was dead with the stock head as well -- need to troubleshoot, but it's not a problem w/ the KSPIV. |
| Waze | Installs from Play Store and works OOTB |
| GPS | Works with the antenna that comes with the headunit shoved up under the dash.  Can take a minute to get lock if you don't power it up every day.  Not working with the stock Expedition antenna at this time. Can take quite a while to get lock the very first time -- try sticking the antenna on the roof to get the initial lock before hiding it in the dash. |
| YouTube | Pre-installed and working OOTB |
| Netflix | Not available in the Play Store for Android 9.  If you write to KSPIV support, they'll send you an APK that works along with instructions on how to side-load it. |
| Play Store | Crashed a lot at first.  After finding a work-around to updating Play Store itself, it now works as it should.  Some apps are not available as the head is running Android 9 which is pretty outdated.  KSPIV is working on an Android 11 firmware for this unit that should improve the situation. |
